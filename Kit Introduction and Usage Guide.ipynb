    "# Welcome to the Anomaly Detection Template Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "This AI Template Kit provides a complete, production-oriented implementation of image-based anomaly detection using three advanced methods: **VAE**, **PatchCore**, and **DRAEM**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s not just a tutorial — it’s a modular, extensible framework designed for real-world use in industrial settings. All components are structured to be immediately applicable in projects while remaining transparent and well-documented for hands-on understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The included pipelines target **visual anomaly detection** using the real-world **AITEX Fabric Defect Detection Dataset**. This dataset presents a realistic challenge: detecting subtle defects in highly repetitive, texture-rich fabric rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is essential across industries — from quality assurance in manufacturing to predictive maintenance and safety monitoring. This kit enables you to explore and deploy robust deep learning solutions tailored to such needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AITEX?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using simplified benchmark datasets, we chose **AITEX** for several important reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It contains **tiny, localized anomalies**, such as faint line disruptions or small weaving inconsistencies, which pose a real challenge for modern models.\n",
    "- The dataset is made up of **highly regular, repeating textures** typical of fabric surfaces, which makes false positives more likely if the model doesn't truly understand the texture.\n",
    "- AITEX reflects a **real-world industrial use case**, demanding both precision and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working with AITEX, you're not only learning techniques but also preparing for scenarios that mirror actual applications in manufacturing and quality control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📂 Dataset: AITEX Fabric Dataset (AFID)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook series is designed to work with the **AITEX Fabric Dataset (AFID)**, which contains high-resolution fabric images with and without anomalies. These images are ideal for training and evaluating anomaly detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔗 Download the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The AITEX dataset is **not included** in this package due to potential licensing restrictions.  \n",
    "To use it, please download the dataset manually from the official AITEX project page:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 [https://www.aitex.es/afid/](https://www.aitex.es/afid/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ **Important Licensing Note:**  \n",
    "> According to the information available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/veeranjaniraju/fabric-anomaly-detection), the AITEX dataset may be subject to a **non-commercial use license**. The official AITEX website does **not explicitly specify** the terms of use.  \n",
    ">  \n",
    "> Therefore, this notebook series uses the dataset **strictly for educational and research purposes**.  \n",
    "> **Please consult the AITEX source directly** to confirm that your intended use complies with any licensing restrictions before applying this material in commercial settings.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 🧰 Dataset Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have downloaded the dataset, follow the instructions in the `notebooks/00_preparation/Dataset Setup.ipynb` notebook to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract the files to the `data/` folder\n",
    "- Organize the subfolders as expected (e.g., `Defect`, `NoDefect`, `Mask`)\n",

    "## 📖 Structure of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick overview of what to expect from each branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch 01: VAE**  \n",
    "  You'll explore how Variational Autoencoders learn representations of normal images, enabling them to highlight anomalies through reconstruction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch 02: PatchCore**  \n",
    "  Discover an efficient, memory-based anomaly detection method leveraging pretrained CNN feature embeddings and fast nearest-neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch 03: DRÆM**  \n",
    "  Deep-dive into a modern, reconstruction-based method designed explicitly for visual anomaly detection, known for its sensitivity and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch 04: Operationalization**  \n",
    "  Learn how to deploy and integrate your trained anomaly detection model into a practical, real-world scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each branch is structured to help you understand both the strengths and limitations of these methods, providing clarity about the optimal scenarios for their application.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",

    "# 🚀 Getting Started: Setting up Your Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the content, let’s set up your local development environment so you can fully benefit from all features including model training, evaluation, and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is designed to work on **Linux-based systems**, including **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** with **Ubuntu**. While any Python-capable IDE can be used, I recommend **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** for a good developer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Step 1: Extract the Project Files\n",
    "\n",
    "After purchasing this series, you received a `.zip` file containing the complete project. To get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Example: extract to your WSL home directory or any other linux compatible based enironment\n",
    "cd ~\n",
    "unzip /mnt/c/Users/<YourUsername>/Downloads/AnomalyDetectionSeries.zip -d anomaly-detection\n",
    "cd anomaly-detection\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧪 Step 3: Python Environment Setup (with GPU Support)\n",
    "\n",

    "# 🧭 How to Work with This Template Kit\n",
    "\n",
    "This AI Template Kit is designed to provide more than runnable code — it's a complete, structured foundation for building and understanding anomaly detection systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're planning to integrate these modules into production or use them to deepen your machine learning knowledge, this kit supports both goals.  \n",
    "**It's not a shortcut — but a launchpad.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🧠 **Think beyond execution**: Don’t just run the cells. Take time to understand the logic behind each step.\n",
    "- 🔧 **Experiment freely**: Adjust parameters, change components, observe how the behavior changes. The system is modular for a reason.\n",
    "- 🛠️ **Use your development tools**: Much of the core logic lives in the `codebase/` and `inference/codebase/` folders. Use your IDE’s navigation and search to explore how things work under the hood.\n",
    "- 🧭 **You don’t need to understand everything at once**: Come back to tricky parts later. Learning and integration are iterative.\n",
    "- 📚 **Use the notebooks as guidance**, not as a complete mirror of the source code. To keep things readable, not every logic detail is repeated inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Structure Reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and architecture code: `codebase/`\n",
    "- Inference logic and deployment scripts: `inference/codebase/`\n",
    "- Configuration, checkpoints, and tracking: in the respective notebook directories\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ This is a production-aligned resource. If you're here to learn, you'll get the most value by actively exploring and connecting the pieces — not by passively running cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kit is the result of building, testing, debugging, and adapting real pipelines — and it’s made to help you do the same, faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 📓 Opening the First Notebook\n",
