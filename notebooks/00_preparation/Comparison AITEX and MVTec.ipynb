    "\n",
    "### Most anomaly detection methods - especially VAEs and PatchCore - rely on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear visual separation** between normal and anomalous regions\n",
    "- **Semantic or large-scale disruptions** in the input\n",
    "- Feature extractors (e.g., ResNet) that can detect such differences in **feature space**\n",
    "\n",
    "On MVTec Carpet:\n",
    "> The anomalies are **big and obvious** ‚Üí most methods can‚Äôt miss them.\n",
    "\n",
    "On AITEX:\n",
    "> The anomalies are **subtle, localized, and low contrast** ‚Üí only models with high texture sensitivity (like DRAEM) succeed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misinterpretation in Literature\n",
    "\n",
    "Many anomaly detection papers claim state-of-the-art performance on MVTec, but:\n",
    "- That does **not translate** to fabrics like AITEX.\n",
    "- Their results are often inflated by **high-contrast, spatially distinct defects**.\n",
    "- Models are not pushed to detect **within-class fine-grained deviations** which is exactly the challenge AITEX presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Why This Justifies Your Deep Dive\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project is exposing the **next-level challenge** in anomaly detection:\n",
    "- Not just ‚Äúcan you detect that something is wrong?‚Äù\n",
    "- But **‚Äúcan you tell when something is just slightly wrong and in a way that looks statistically normal?‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs a much harder task and AITEX is a perfect testbed for it."
