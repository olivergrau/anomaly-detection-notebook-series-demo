    "# **Project: Anomaly Detection for AITEX Dataset**\n",

    "## `Notebook 7`: Diagnostic Playbook for VAE Training\n",
    "**Author**: Oliver Grau \n",

    "**Date**: 27.03.2025  \n",
    "**Version**: 1.0\n",

    "**Symptoms â†’ Root Causes â†’ Suggested Actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 1: Precision, Recall, F1 = 0 but ROC AUC > 0.5**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### âœ… Meaning:\n",
    "- The model ranks anomalies *slightly better than chance*\n",
    "- But the **threshold** results in **no correct detections**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Threshold too high (e.g., 95th percentile) for early-stage or weak reconstructions\n",
    "- Error distribution too narrow (over-smoothing)\n",
    "- Too little separation between normal and defect errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Manually adjust threshold (e.g., 85â€“90 percentile) and rerun evaluation\n",
    "- Plot error histogram (normal vs defect)\n",
    "- Apply **early stopping** before over-smoothing flattens differences\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 2: All reconstructions look the same**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Decoder is ignoring latent code (posterior collapse)\n",
    "- KL weight too high too early\n",
    "- Latent space underutilized\n",
    "- Over-regularization or low decoder capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Lower `kl_weight`, or use **KL annealing** over epochs\n",
    "- Increase decoder capacity (more ConvTranspose, residuals, etc.)\n",
    "- Visualize Î¼ and Ïƒ histograms\n",
    "- Try **Conditional VAE** (add fabric code as input)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 3: Heatmaps are almost all red or uniform**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Model fails to reconstruct almost everything (underfitting)\n",
    "- Reconstruction quality is low overall â€” too noisy or blurred\n",
    "- Might also occur if decoder is too weak or latent too small\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Train longer (if early epochs)\n",
    "- Increase latent dimensionality (e.g., 32 â†’ 64 or 128)\n",
    "- Use BatchNorm or better weight initialization in decoder\n",
    "- Try skip connections or shallow UNet-style decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 4: Latent Î¼ is flat or centered too tightly around 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Posterior collapse: model ignores latent code\n",
    "- Decoder learns to reconstruct without variability\n",
    "- KL loss dominates too early\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Apply **KL warm-up/annealing**\n",
    "- Lower `kl_weight`\n",
    "- Visualize latent histograms regularly (you already do that well)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 5: Ïƒ â†’ 0 or Ïƒ very narrow**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Encoder is too confident â†’ latent sampling becomes deterministic\n",
    "- Anomalies won't be well explored in latent space\n",
    "- No uncertainty modeled\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Add noise to input (mild)\n",
    "- Reduce encoder layer depth\n",
    "- Lower `kl_weight` (let encoder explore more)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”´ **SYMPTOM 6: ROC stays ~0.55â€“0.60 across training, never improves**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ§  Root Cause:\n",
    "- Latent space or decoder isn't expressive enough\n",
    "- Model has no capacity to distinguish anomaly-specific cues\n",
    "- Dataset doesn't contain detectable differences at patch level\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ðŸ›  Suggested Actions:\n",
    "- Try multi-fabric training (if back on per-fabric now)\n",
    "- Increase latent size or decoder width\n",
    "- Use hybrid loss with higher frequency weighting\n",
    "- Re-check if defect masks align well with image patches\n",
