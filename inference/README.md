# ðŸ§ª Inference Pipeline (Operationalization Track)

This folder contains the source code for the **inference and deployment pipeline**, designed to **serve trained anomaly detection models** in a scalable and production-ready environment.

Unlike the research notebooks, this pipeline is structured for **real-world operationalization** and is intended to run independently from the training code.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Technologies Used

- **MLflow** â€“ for experiment tracking and model versioning  
- **FastAPI** â€“ for building a high-performance REST API to serve model predictions  
- **Render** â€“ for cloud deployment of the FastAPI app  
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ for CI/CD automation and continuous deployment

---

## ðŸ“¦ Notes

- This pipeline is **decoupled** from the training notebooks to ensure clear separation of concerns.
- Designed to be **customizable** for any of the three methods (VAE, PatchCore, DRAEM).
- **Model weights are not included** â€“ users are expected to train and log their own models before serving.
